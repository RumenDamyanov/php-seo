### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Test Structure

```php
<?php

test('it generates SEO title from page content', function () {
    $seoManager = new SeoManager();
    $content = '<h1>Welcome to Our Site</h1><p>Great content here.</p>';
    
    $seoManager->analyze($content);
    $title = $seoManager->generateTitle();
    
    expect($title)->toBeString()
        ->and($title)->not->toBeEmpty()
        ->and(strlen($title))->toBeLessThanOrEqual(60);
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/SeoManagerTest.php

# Run tests with coverage
composer test-coverage

# Run tests in watch mode (if available)
./vendor/bin/pest --watch
```

## Code Style

We follow PSR-12 coding standards with some additional rules:

### PHP Standards

- Use strict types: `declare(strict_types=1);`
- Use type hints for all parameters and return types
- Use proper PHPDoc comments
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards

### Code Organization

- Keep classes focused and single-purpose
- Use dependency injection
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code

### Example

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Rumenx\PhpSeo\Generators;

use Rumenx\PhpSeo\Config\SeoConfig;
use Rumenx\PhpSeo\Contracts\GeneratorInterface;

/**
 * Generator for creating SEO-optimized content.
 */
class ExampleGenerator implements GeneratorInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly SeoConfig $config
    ) {
    }

    /**
     * Generate content from page data.
     *
     * @param array<string, mixed> $pageData
     * @return string
     */
    public function generate(array $pageData): string
    {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```
